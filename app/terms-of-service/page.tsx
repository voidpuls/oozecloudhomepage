                  This agreement shall be governed by the laws of the [Insert State/Country].

              <div className="space-y-3">
                <p>
                  For services described as "unlimited" or "unmetered," including but not limited to storage, bandwidth, or other resources, clients are expected to adhere to a fair use standard to maintain service quality for all users. We reserve the right to enforce reasonable usage limits where necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to determine whether a client has violated the fair use policy. If so, the company may terminate the client's services immediately and without prior notice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A fair use threshold is set at no more than 10% of overall system resources or network bandwidth. If usage exceeds 5% but remains below 10%, the client will receive a written notice requesting immediate resolution. Failure to comply may result in further action.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Clients should exercise reasonable judgment to ensure compliance with fair use policies.

                  We reserve the right to terminate services at our discretion for violations of policies, including abuse or acceptable use violations.

                <p>
                  In cases of abuse-related termination, data may be retained up to 365 days, subject to circumstances, and may be shared with authorities as required.
